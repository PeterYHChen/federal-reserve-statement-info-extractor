The
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
decided
today
to
lower
its
target
for
the
federal
funds
rate
50
basis
points
to
4-3/4
percent
.

Economic
growth
was
moderate
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
,
but
the
tightening
of
credit
conditions
has
the
potential
to
intensify
the
housing
correction
and
to
restrain
economic
growth
more
generally
.

Today's
action
is
intended
to
help
forestall
some
of
the
adverse
effects
on
the
broader
economy
that
might
otherwise
arise
from
the
disruptions
in
financial
markets
and
to
promote
moderate
growth
over
time
.

Readings
on
core
inflation
have
improved
modestly
this
year
.

However
,
the
Committee
judges
that
some
inflation
risks
remain
,
and
it
will
continue
to
monitor
inflation
developments
carefully
.

Developments
in
financial
markets
since
the
Committee's
last
regular
meeting
have
increased
the
uncertainty
surrounding
the
economic
outlook
.

The
Committee
will
continue
to
assess
the
effects
of
these
and
other
developments
on
economic
prospects
and
will
act
as
needed
to
foster
price
stability
and
sustainable
economic
growth
.

in
the

In

The
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
decided
today
to
lower
its
target
for
the
federal
funds
rate
50
basis
points
to
1
percent
.

The
pace
of
economic
activity
appears
to
have
slowed
markedly
,
owing
importantly
to
a
decline
in
consumer
expenditures
.

Business
equipment
spending
and
industrial
production
have
weakened
in
recent
months
,
and
slowing
economic
activity
in
many
foreign
economies
is
damping
the
prospects
for
U.S
.

exports
.

Moreover
,
the
intensification
of
financial
market
turmoil
is
likely
to
exert
additional
restraint
on
spending
,
partly
by
further
reducing
the
ability
of
households
and
businesses
to
obtain
credit
.

In
light
of
the
declines
in
the
prices
of
energy
and
other
commodities
and
the
weaker
prospects
for
economic
activity
,
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
moderate
in
coming
quarters
to
levels
consistent
with
price
stability
.

Recent
policy
actions
,
including
today's
rate
reduction
,
coordinated
interest
rate
cuts
by
central
banks
,
extraordinary
liquidity
measures
,
and
official
steps
to
strengthen
financial
systems
,
should
help
over
time
to
improve
credit
conditions
and
promote
a
return
to
moderate
economic
growth
.

Nevertheless
,
downside
risks
to
growth
remain
.

The
Committee
will
monitor
economic
and
financial
developments
carefully
and
will
act
as
needed
to
promote
sustainable
economic
growth
and
price
stability

The
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
decided
today
to
raise
its
target
for
the
federal
funds
rate
by
25
basis
points
to
5-1/4
percent
.

Recent
indicators
suggest
that
economic
growth
is
moderating
from
its
quite
strong
pace
earlier
this
year
,
partly
reflecting
a
gradual
cooling
of
the
housing
market
and
the
lagged
effects
of
increases
in
interest
rates
and
energy
prices
.

Readings
on
core
inflation
have
been
elevated
in
recent
months
.

Ongoing
productivity
gains
have
held
down
the
rise
in
unit
labor
costs
,
and
inflation
expectations
remain
contained
.

However
,
the
high
levels
of
resource
utilization
and
of
the
prices
of
energy
and
other
commodities
have
the
potential
to
sustain
inflation
pressures
.

Although
the
moderation
in
the
growth
of
aggregate
demand
should
help
to
limit
inflation
pressures
over
time
,
the
Committee
judges
that
some
inflation
risks
remain
.

The
extent
and
timing
of
any
additional
firming
that
may
be
needed
to
address
these
risks
will
depend
on
the
evolution
of
the
outlook
for
both
inflation
and
economic
growth
,
as
implied
by
incoming
information
.

In
any
event
,
the
Committee
will
respond
to
changes
in
economic
prospects
as
needed
to
support
the
attainment
of
its
objectives

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
continued
to
strengthen
and
that
the
deterioration
in
the
labor
market
is
abating
.

Household
spending
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
rate
but
remains
constrained
by
a
weak
labor
market
,
modest
income
growth
,
lower
housing
wealth
,
and
tight
credit
.

Business
spending
on
equipment
and
software
appears
to
be
picking
up
,
but
investment
in
structures
is
still
contracting
and
employers
remain
reluctant
to
add
to
payrolls
.

Firms
have
brought
inventory
stocks
into
better
alignment
with
sales
.

While
bank
lending
continues
to
contract
,
financial
market
conditions
remain
supportive
of
economic
growth
.

Although
the
pace
of
economic
recovery
is
likely
to
be
moderate
for
a
time
,
the
Committee
anticipates
a
gradual
return
to
higher
levels
of
resource
utilization
in
a
context
of
price
stability
.

With
substantial
resource
slack
continuing
to
restrain
cost
pressures
and
with
longer-term
inflation
expectations
stable
,
inflation
is
likely
to
be
subdued
for
some
time
.

The
Committee
will
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
continues
to
anticipate
that
economic
conditions
,
including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
,
subdued
inflation
trends
,
and
stable
inflation
expectations
,
are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
of
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period
.

To
provide
support
to
mortgage
lending
and
housing
markets
and
to
improve
overall
conditions
in
private
credit
markets
,
the
Federal
Reserve
is
in
the
process
of
purchasing
$
1.25
trillion
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
about
$
175
billion
of
agency
debt
.

In
order
to
promote
a
smooth
transition
in
markets
,
the
Committee
is
gradually
slowing
the
pace
of
these
purchases
,
and
it
anticipates
that
these
transactions
will
be
executed
by
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
.

The
Committee
will
continue
to
evaluate
its
purchases
of
securities
in
light
of
the
evolving
economic
outlook
and
conditions
in
financial
markets
.

In
light
of
improved
functioning
of
financial
markets
,
the
Federal
Reserve
will
be
closing
the
Asset-Backed
Commercial
Paper

Mutual
Fund
Liquidity

,
the
Commercial

,
and
the
Term
Securities
Lending
Facility
on
February
1
,
as
previously
announced
.

In
addition
,
the
temporary
liquidity
swap
arrangements
between
the
Federal
Reserve
and
other
central
banks
will
expire
on
February
1
.

The
Federal
Reserve
is
in
the
process
of
winding
down
its
Term
Auction
Facility
:
$
50
billion
in
28
-
day
credit
will
be
offered
on
February
8
and
$
25
billion
in
28
-
day
credit
will
be
offered
at
the
final
auction
on
March
8
.

The
anticipated
expiration
dates
for
the
Term
Asset-Backed
Securities
Loan
Facility
remain
set
at
June
30
for

mortgage-backed
securities
and
March
31
for
loans
backed
by
all
other
types
of
collateral
.

The
Federal
Reserve
is
prepared
to
modify
these
plans
if
necessary
to
support
financial
stability
and
economic
growth
.

Voting
against
the
policy
action
was
Thomas
M
.
Hoenig
,
who
believed
that
economic
and
financial
conditions
had
changed
sufficiently
that
the
expectation
of
exceptionally
low
levels
of
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period
was
no
longer
warranted
.

The
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
its
target
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
5-1/4
percent
.

Economic
growth
slowed
in
the
first
part
of
this
year
and
the
adjustment
in
the
housing
sector
is
ongoing
.

Nevertheless
,
the
economy
seems
likely
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
over
coming
quarters
.

Core
inflation
remains
somewhat
elevated
.

Although
inflation
pressures
seem
likely
to
moderate
over
time
,
the
high
level
of
resource
utilization
has
the
potential
to
sustain
those
pressures
.

In
these
circumstances
,
the
Committee's
predominant
policy
concern
remains
the
risk
that
inflation
will
fail
to
moderate
as
expected
.

Future
policy
adjustments
will
depend
on
the
evolution
of
the
outlook
for
both
inflation
and
economic
growth
,

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
August
indicates
that
economic
growth
remains
slow
.

Recent
indicators
point
to
continuing
weakness
in
overall
labor
market
conditions
,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated
.

Household
spending
has
been
increasing
at
only
a
modest
pace
in
recent
months
despite
some
recovery
in
sales
of
motor
vehicles
as
supply-chain
disruptions
eased
.

Investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak
,
and
the
housing
sector
remains
depressed
.

However
,
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continues
to
expand
.

Inflation
appears
to
have
moderated
since
earlier
in
the
year
as
prices
of
energy
and
some
commodities
have
declined
from
their
peaks
.

Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable
.

Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate
,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability
.

The
Committee
continues
to
expect
some
pickup
in
the
pace
of
recovery
over
coming
quarters
but
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
only
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate
.

Moreover
,
there
are
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
,
including
strains
in
global
financial
markets
.

The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
will
settle
,
over
coming
quarters
,
at
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate
as
the
effects
of
past
energy
and
other
commodity
price
increases
dissipate
further
.

However
,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations
.

To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation
,
over
time
,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
the
dual
mandate
,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities
.

The
Committee
intends
to
purchase
,
by
the
end
of
June
2012
,
$
400
billion
of
Treasury
securities
with
remaining
maturities
of
6
years
to
30
years
and
to
sell
an
equal
amount
of
Treasury
securities
with
remaining
maturities
of
3
years
or
less
.

This
program
should
put
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates
and
help
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative
.

The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate
.

To
help
support
conditions
in
mortgage
markets
,
the
Committee
will
now
reinvest
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
.

In
addition
,
the
Committee
will
maintain
its
existing
policy
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction
.

The
Committee
also
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
least
through
mid-2013
.

The
Committee
discussed
the
range
of
policy
tools
available
to
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
in
a
context
of
price
stability
.

It
will
continue
to
assess
the
economic
outlook
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
is
prepared
to
employ
its
tools
as
appropriate
.
