Deflation - The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below(deflation) 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.
None      - The Committee 's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee 's dual mandate.
Inflation - If incoming information broadly supports the Committee 's expectation(inflation) of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting.
None      - However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee 's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee 's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

Inflation - Although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower(deflation) energy prices and other factors, the Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below(deflation) 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.
None      - In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress -- both realized and expected -- toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

None      - However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee 's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.

Deflation - The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below(deflation) levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.
None      - Voting against the action was Narayana Kocherlakota, who believed that, in light of continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, the Committee should commit to keeping the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until the one-to-two-year ahead inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent and should continue the asset purchase program at its current level.

Deflation - The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below(deflation) levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.
Inflation - Voting against the action were Richard W. Fisher, who believed that, while the Committee should be patient in beginning to normalize monetary policy, improvement in the U.S. economic performance since October has moved forward, further than the majority of the Committee envisions, the date when it will likely be appropriate to increase(inflation) the federal funds rate; Narayana Kocherlakota, who believed that the Committee 's decision, in the context of ongoing low(deflation) inflation and falling market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, created undue downside(deflation) risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target; and Charles I. Plosser, who believed that the statement should not stress the importance of the passage of time as a key element of its forward guidance and, given the improvement in economic conditions, should not emphasize the consistency of the current forward guidance with previous statements.
