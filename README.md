# federal-reserve-statement-info-extractor

Our group proposal is to write a code that will examine the text of the Federal Open Market’s
Committee post meeting communique. The website with all of the present and past communication is:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm

FOMC statements are impactful and market moving. There is much information to extract from the
statement, such as sentiment of the federal reserve’s view on economic growth and inflation or the
choice the open markets committee made for the base interest rate.
